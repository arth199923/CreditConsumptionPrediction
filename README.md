Predicting Credit Consumption for Leading Bank

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting credit card consumption for a leading bank's customers. The project utilizes customer demographics and behavioral data to forecast credit card spend for the next three months.

Business Context:

In the modern banking industry, data analytics plays a crucial role in understanding customer behavior and driving strategic marketing initiatives. Leveraging customer demographics and behavioral data, banks can tailor their offerings and marketing campaigns to meet the needs of individual customers, thereby increasing sales and revenue.

Business Objectives:

Utilize customer demographics and behavioral data to predict credit card consumption for the next three months.
Develop a model that can accurately forecast credit card spend based on various customer characteristics.
Improve customer relationship management and enable strategic marketing planning for the bank.
Data Description:

The data provided consists of three main datasets:

CustomerDemographics.csv: Contains information about customer demographics including ID, account type, gender, age, income levels, employment tenure, tenure with the bank, region code, net banking usage, and average days between transactions.

CustomerBehaviorData.csv: Includes customer behavioral data such as credit card and debit card spend for April, May, and June, number of credit card and debit card transactions, credit card limit, active and closed loans, investments, debit and credit amounts, and loan enquiries.

CreditConsumptionData.csv: Contains the target variable, average credit card spend in the next three months, for each customer.

Model Evaluation Metric:

The model will be evaluated using the Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) between the predicted credit card consumption and the actual credit consumption.

Expected Outputs:

a. Detailed code with comments for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

b. Data exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

c. Model validation outputs including performance metrics and visualizations.

d. Model documentation providing insights into the model architecture, hyperparameters, and methodology.

e. Predicted values for customers where the target variable has missing values.
